# Images Directory Structure

This directory contains all the images used in the blog.

## Directory Structure

```
images/
├── blog/       # Blog post related images
├── icons/      # Icons and small graphics
└── common/     # Common images used across the site
    ├── blog-logo.png        # Site logo
    └── hero-background.png  # Hero section background
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Place new images in the appropriate directory based on their use:
   - Blog post images -> `blog/`
   - Icons and small graphics -> `icons/`
   - Site-wide images -> `common/`

2. Image Naming Convention:
   - Use lowercase letters
   - Use hyphens for spaces
   - Use descriptive names
   - Example: `blog-post-thumbnail.png`

3. Recommended Image Formats:
   - PNG: For logos, icons, and images requiring transparency
   - JPEG: For photographs and complex images
   - SVG: For scalable graphics and icons

4. Image Optimization:
   - Compress images before adding them
   - Keep file sizes reasonable
   - Use appropriate dimensions
